# Chat-application-java
This project is structured around two key modules: the server and the client, following a client-server model. In this model, the client sends requests, and the server responds to these requests. The server serves as a computer program providing services to other programs or users across different machines. It may be a dedicated server or used for other functions, such as a database or proxy server. The server is always active, waiting for client requests, even though clients may come and go. It listens on a specific port, and when a client initiates a connection, a dedicated communication channel is established. Each client is assigned a local port number, and communication occurs via sockets, with the server and client agreeing on a protocol for data exchange.

On the client side, the client knows the server's hostname and the port number to establish a connection. Once connected, the client uses a local port for communication, which is typically assigned by the system. This project uses a single server-single client model.

Additionally, the chatting application includes features like a login and sign-up page. Data provided during sign-up are stored in a database for future use during login. The system also enables users to search for registered users by name, year, or branch. The program accesses the stored database and displays the relevant users based on the input criteria during the search process.
